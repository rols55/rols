## Description

Our goal was to create a website that makes it easy for anyone to create their own ASCII art. With our website, you can simply type in any text you want (not any, but almost any), pick a style you like (standard, shadow, thinkertoy), and voila! You'll have your very own unique ASCII art piece. Plus, you can even download it as a .txt file to share or use however you'd like. We put a lot of effort into creating a unique and user-friendly design for our website. And it looks like it paid off - more than 100% of users have told us they'll be back to visit us again, not just for the ASCII art but for the overall experience of using our website ;)!

## Usage

Running the program is a breeze. Just make sure you've done all the necessary preparation, then simply type "go run ." into the command line and press Enter. After that open your browser and surf with <http://localhost:8080> It's that easy!

## Implementation details: algorithm

You're probably wondering what we did here. We set up a server using GO's ListenAndServe. Then we designed the website, including the input form where you can type in your text and the output page where you can see the ASCII art (HTML). We made sure the server and the website talk to each other properly (POST, GET), and lastly we added a feature where you can download your ASCII art. All of this was done while keeping the design user-friendly and easy to navigate (CSS).
