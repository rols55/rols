Objectives
Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII. Time to write big.

What we mean by a graphic representation using ASCII, is to write the string received using ASCII characters, as you can see in the example below:

This project should handle an input with numbers, letters, spaces, special characters and \n.
Take a look at the ASCII manual.
Instructions
Your project must be written in Go.

The code must respect the good practices.

It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

Some banner files with a specific graphical template representation using ASCII will be given. The files are formatted in a way that is not necessary to change them.

shadow
standard
thinkertoy

Banner Format
Each character has a height of 8 lines.
Characters are separated by a new line \n.
Here is an example of ' ', '!' and '"'(one dot represents one space) :

Allowed packages
Only the standard Go packages are allowed
This project will help you learn about :

The Go file system(fs) API
Data manipulation
